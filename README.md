Pleased with:
Utilisation of sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for prime generation, I like that it's able to produce high numbered primes
without being overly complicated. Additionally the chance to use other optimisation features/tools such as fragments for
front-end displaying of content. Above that I enjoyed getting to use tools such as https://jsperf.com/ to test code run speed
it was helping in creating a more fluid and optimised application without teh requirement for installing additional tools.

What I would do with more time:
With additional time I would work on increasing the performance regarding the front-end.
Despite my earlier mention of fragments, I feel they may have been under utilised within this project. I also think the 
front-end could do with refinement, feedback is lacking for the user in regards to whats going on. One example of this is
the lack of feedback when the user exceeds the max limits of the prime generation.


Additional notes:
Hard limites have been imposed to try stop browsers crashing or erroring out, during testing the browser which worked best
was surprisingly Safari which was able to load the multiplication table significantly faster than any other browser.
